## About the Game
 
**Memory Match Game** is a web-based memory game where players flip over cards and try to find pairs of matching images. Itâ€™s a fun and simple game that tests players' memory and concentration.
 
The player must reveal two cards at a time, trying to find a match. If the two cards match, they stay revealed; otherwise, they are flipped back over. The game continues until all matches are found or the time runs out.
 
## Features
 
- Grid of hidden images (cards).
- Player clicks on cards to reveal the images.
- Cards remain flipped if they are a match, otherwise, they flip back.
- Timer functionality: if time runs out, the player loses.
- Scoring system to track the number of attempts.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
